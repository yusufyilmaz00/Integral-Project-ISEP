# Use Case Diagram (UCD)

**In the scope of this project, there is a direct relationship of _1 to 1_ between Use Cases (UC) and User Stories (US).**

However, be aware, this is a pedagogical simplification. On further projects and course units there may also exist _1 to N **and/or** N to 1_ relationships between UC and US.
